This simple Python tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt files of a certain format. It provides a user-friendly interface for securing files with encryption and managing a local list of up to 1000 encrypted files. Additionally, the list of files and their details are stored in a MySQL database for easy & secure retrieval. There is also a password required to open the application. By default the password is `admin` however, the application gives an option to change it.
